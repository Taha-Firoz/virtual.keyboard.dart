> Flutter Virtual Keyboard

The definitive landscape virtual keyboard for flutter projects that can't support regular virtual keyboards (embedded). This is a fork from the original [virtual_keyboard](https://github.com/fedepaj/virtual_keyboard) and fixes a lot of the major issues with that project. Since there were many changes in how the library is layed out internally uploading the keyboard as a separate project seemed like a better idea. 

Your contributions are welcome to the project.
